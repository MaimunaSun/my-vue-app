# my-vue-app
This project is a memory game built using the Vue.js JavaScript framework. When the application loads, users are taken to the Start Page. From there, they are prompted to start the game by entering their player names via a modal popup. After submitting their names, users are directed to the Welcome Page, where they can view their player names and avatars. When ready, they can click "Play Game" to proceed to the Game Board page and begin playing.
